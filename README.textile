h1. Mizzou news app

News app for the Nov. 9-11 training at Mizzou.

h2. Getting started

There are two ways you can get started using this app: cloning it from git or building it from scratch (like we did in class). We'll talk about the cloning option first.

h3. Cloning from git

Cloning the app from git will allow you to have a full functional version of the app on your desktop from the get-go, rather than having to rebuild it yourself. This will let you play with the code, make changes, and see how those changes affect the app.

Cloning is easy. If you have git installed, simply navigate to the Desktop (or any other directory you prefer) on the command line and type:

@git clone git://github.com/ireapps/mizzou-newsapp.git@

You should see the application download. For students who attended the class, you should already have all the necessary Python libraries installed. For those who don't, you can quickly install them like so using Python's handy @pip@ utility:

@pip install -r requirements.txt@

Once that's complete, simply navigate into the directory containing manage.py and type @python manage.py runserver@ and the app should start as normal. Remember that you can view it in your browser at the address *127.0.0.1:8000*.

h3. Starting from scratch

To build this application from scratch, as we did in class, requires a few more steps. Start by installing django using the standard @pip install django@ command. Then navigate to the directory of your choice and start a new project like so:

@django-admin.py startproject mizzou@

You'll see a new directory structure be created for your project. Navigate into the directory, and then into the separate *mizzou* subdirectory underneath it. Now you'll want to configure your DATABASES setting to create a new SQLite database. The easiest way to do that is to copy the settings from this repository and paste them into your local copy.

Next you'll have to set up your database. Navigate back to the directory where your manage.py file is stored and type:

@python manage.py syncdb@

Follow the prompts to create a superuser while you're at it.
