h1. Mizzou news app

News app for the Nov. 9-11 training at Mizzou.

h2. Getting started

There are two ways you can get started using this app: cloning it from git or building it from scratch (like we did in class). We'll talk about the cloning option first.

h3. Cloning from git

Cloning the app from git will allow you to have a full functional version of the app on your desktop from the get-go, rather than having to rebuild it yourself. This will let you play with the code, make changes, and see how those changes affect the app.

Cloning is easy. If you have git installed, simply navigate to the Desktop (or any other directory you prefer) on the command line and type:

@git clone XXX@
